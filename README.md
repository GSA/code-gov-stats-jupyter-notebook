## Code.gov stats with Jupyter Notebook
Extract some stats for Code.gov using the Github GraphQL API

To view the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-stats-jupyter-notebook/blob/master/code-gov-github-stats.ipynb)

This repository is useful once you have all unique repository owners (AKA agencies for Code.gov) or if you use the [U.S. Federal Agency List](https://github.com/github/government.github.com/blob/gh-pages/_data/governments.yml#L621) compiled by Github.

The goal is to extract some basic repository information / stats from the Code.gov inventory. The data we are interested in is:

- Owner name
- Owner email
- Owner Github URL
- Repo's name with owner
- Repo's created at date
- Total fork count
- Is the repo a fork
- Total watchers
- Total stargazers
- Total pull requests
- Total issues

Eg.

```Python
{
 'created_at': '2012-01-26T17:30:51Z',
 'fork_count': 24,
 'is_fork': False,
 'issues': 50,
 'name_with_owner': 'cfpb/django-nudge',
 'owner_email': '',
 'owner_name': 'Consumer Financial Protection Bureau',
 'owner_url': 'https://github.com/cfpb',
 'pull_request': 13,
 'stargazers': 75,
 'watchers': 13
}
```

## Dependencies
### Github Dependencies

This Jupyter Notebook makes use of Github GraphQL API (API v4). If you are unfamiliar with GraphQL and/or Github API v4 we recommend reading:

- [GraphQL - Learn](http://graphql.org/learn/)
- [Github API v4](https://developer.github.com/v4/)

We also recommend taking a look at [Github's GraphQL API v4 Explorer](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/). With this tool you will be able to test the GraphQL queries that we use in this notebook.

### Python Dependencies

- Python 3.6+ - Should work with other versions of Python but has not been tested. To install Python please take a look at: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
